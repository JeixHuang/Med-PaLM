from med_palm import MedPalm

# Kick-start the model
model = MedPalm()

# Let's get some tokenized inputs going
text_tokens = torch.tensor([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]])  # Just an example! Use your own data.
images = torch.randn(1, 3, 224, 224)  # This too!

# Let Med-PaLM work its magic!
output = model(text_tokens, images)

# Voila! 🎉
print(output)
```
📝 Note: Modify the examples to suit your data and project needs.
